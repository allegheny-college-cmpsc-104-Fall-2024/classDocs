## Course Description
An introduction to the creation of effective documents and documentation using industry-standard approaches to creating and treating "documentation as code". Through project-based and hands-on activities, students create purpose-driven digital writing, emphasizing the forms, formats, and conventions expected in contemporary technical communication. Students also gain experience in creating collaborative and ethically-consistent content within a team-based setting. During a weekly laboratory session, students employ contemporary software tools to complete technical documentation projects, reporting their results through written reflections and oral presentations.

## Distribution Requirements
### Human Experience (HE)
The study of Human Experience explores human physical, mental, emotional, and/or spiritual experiences as conveyed in texts broadly defined. Through engagement with such texts, students develop an appreciation for human experiences and their representations.

**Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret human experiences as conveyed in texts (including works of visual and performance art, rituals, cultural artifacts and traditions, and/or the written and spoken word).

### Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)
Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

**Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

## Learning Outcomes and Objectives

| Course Objectives | Assessment Method |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Objective 1, 2, 3, and 4 | Exams & Projects|

- **Objective 1**: Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
- **Objective 2**: Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.
- **Objective 3**: Build automated publishing pipelines to format, check, and ensure both the uniformity and quality of digital documents.
- **Objective 4**: Identify and apply appropriate conventions of a variety of technical communities, tools, and computer languages to produce industry-consistent diagrams, summaries, and descriptions of technical topics or processes.

## Required Hardware
A WIFI-ready device is necessary to follow along with course material. You will be instructed on which software to install on your device during the semester.

## Grading

### Grading Components

### Grading Components
- **Class Participation**: Regular participation in class activities is essential for your success in this course. Class participation will be based on your active participation in every class through in-class discussion and exercises. 
- **Exams**: One mid-term exam administered in person. All work submitted for exam must be yours alone. Discussing exam questions with anyone during the exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course. Note that no make-up exam will be given and absence from the exam will be recorded as a zero, unless the absence is excused by a documented emergency or religious observance.
- **Laboratory Assignments**: There will be a total of 10 Lab assignments, due via Github Classroom by 11:59 PM on the given due date. **Late assignments will not be accepted**. Feel free to collaborate in discussing approaches and answers to the problems in small groups. However, each student should turn in a separate, individually prepared set of answers. 
- **Final Project**: The final project requires you to apply the cumulative knowledge and skills from the course to produce a comprehensive set of documentation for a software project. This project will involve creating user manuals, technical architecture documents, and deploying these documents via a JAMstack-powered website. Additionally, you will set up a system that automatically updates and redeploys the documentation whenever changes are made. The project will be assessed on completeness, accuracy, adherence to industry standards, clarity, and the effectiveness of the automated update process. Students must submit individual work along with personal reflections on the process.
